                     Customer Behavior Data Analyst Portfolio Project


This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploration, cleaning, querying, visualization, and reporting.
The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and communicate findings clearly through a dashboard, report, and presentation.

Data
   • The dataset was loaded and processed using Python.
   • It contains structured data suitable for analysis and business insights.

Data quality issues such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats were identified and handled during preprocessing.
(Dataset source can be added here if public or anonymized.)
